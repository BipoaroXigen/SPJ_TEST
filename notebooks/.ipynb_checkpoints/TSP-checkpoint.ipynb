The subtour exchange crossover is my own creation, which stems from a misstake when attempting to implement subtour exchange crossover from https://mat.uab.cat/~alseda/MasterOpt/GeneticOperations.pdf. It behaves very similar to ordered crossover, but creates two children from two parents. Both children are initialized as copies of one parent.

    "LS performs well, especially on small instances. My configurations of ESs reached similar results, but in longer time. Their perfrmance is very depending on choice of crossover and efficiency of the crossover implementation.\n",
    "The memetic algorithms were really good especially when the initial solution was found by the LS.\n",
    "constructive heuristic returns good solution, but the contribution of ES ans LS on its final form is negligible, because it causes the whole population to start in a local optimum making it hard to move anywhere."
